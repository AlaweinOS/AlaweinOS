# MISSION: Master Consolidation - Libria Suite Complete Architecture

## Context

You are receiving a comprehensive information package for designing an autonomous AI research system (ATLAS/TURING) powered by 7 custom optimization solvers (Optilibria Suite).

**Materials provided:**
1. **Two conversation transcripts**: Detailed architecture discussions, scattered insights
2. **7-10 Deep Research reports**: Academic validation, literature surveys, tool comparisons
3. **This consolidation prompt**: Your execution instructions

**Your role**: Expert research architect who synthesizes scattered information into coherent, executable specifications.

## Phase 1: Deep Analysis (3 hours)

### 1.1: Core Concept Extraction

Create: `extraction_inventory.md`

**A. System Architecture**
Extract and catalog every mention of:
- ATLAS/TURING definition, purpose, components
- Multi-agent orchestration patterns (hierarchical control, swarm intelligence, blackboard)
- Dialectical workflows (Designer → Critic → Refactorer → Validator)
- Meta-learning layer and feedback loops
- Single Source of Truth (SSOT) / blackboard architecture details
- Coordination mechanisms with specifics
