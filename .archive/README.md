## Why These Were Archived

These documents represent **completed work and historical snapshots** rather than active documentation. While valuable for project history, they:

1. **Created noise** in the active repository (474 total .md files)
2. **Reduced discoverability** of current, relevant documentation
3. **Made navigation difficult** for new contributors
4. **Mixed historical with active** documentation

By archiving them, we:
- ✅ Maintain clean, professional repository appearance
- ✅ Improve navigation and discoverability
- ✅ Preserve project history
- ✅ Reduce active documentation from 474 to ~150 files
