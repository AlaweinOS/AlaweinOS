# AlaweinOS Archive

This directory contains archived legacy documentation and development artifacts that are no longer actively maintained but preserved for historical reference.

## Directory Structure

### `sessions/`
Session reports and summaries from previous development iterations:
- TalAI session reports (Sessions 2-4, Final, Autonomous)
- MEZAN session summary

**Archived:** 2025-11-19
**Reason:** Historical development records, no longer relevant to current codebase state

### `development/`
Development logs, brainstorming conversations, and planning documents:
- `Important-1.md` - MEZAN original brainstorming conversation (1,363 lines)
- `IDEA_ARCHIVE_ANALYSIS.md` - TalAI idea analysis

**Archived:** 2025-11-19
**Reason:** Early-stage development artifacts, superseded by current implementation

### `prompts/`
Outdated AI assistant superprompts that no longer reflect current project reality:
- `MEZAN_SUPERPROMPT.md` - Described MEZAN as quantum ML platform (outdated)
- `OPTILIBRIA_SUPERPROMPT.md` - Described Optilibria as workflow engine (incorrect)
- `SIMCORE_SUPERPROMPT.md` - Outdated SimCore instructions

**Archived:** 2025-11-19
**Reason:** Descriptions don't match current V4.0.0 implementations
