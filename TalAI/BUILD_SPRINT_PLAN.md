## INTEGRATION STRATEGY

Each new product will integrate with existing TalAI products:

**ResearchPricer:**
- Uses FailureDB for historical success/failure data
- Feeds into GrantWriter for proposal optimization

**ExperimentDesigner:**
- Uses IdeaForge for hypothesis generation
- Integrates with Turingo for protocol optimization
- Outputs to AbstractWriter for publication prep

**GhostResearcher:**
- Uses CrossDomainBridge (when built) for analogies
- Integrates with LitReviewBot for historical context

**LitReviewBot:**
- Uses PaperMiner for bulk analysis
- Feeds into AbstractWriter and AutoPaper (when built)

**GrantWriter:**
- Uses ResearchPricer for ROI justification
- Uses ExperimentDesigner for methodology section
- Uses CitationPredictor for impact assessment

## REVENUE PROJECTIONS

**Conservative (5% conversion):**
- 1 product gains traction
- $150-200/month MRR
- Year 1: $1,800-2,400

**Realistic (10% conversion):**
- 2 products gain traction
- $350-500/month MRR
- Year 1: $4,200-6,000

**Optimistic (20% conversion):**
- 3-4 products gain traction
- $600-900/month MRR
- Year 1: $7,200-10,800

## THE VISION

By end of this week, TalAI will have:
- 19 total products (14 existing + 5 new)
- Complete research workflow coverage:
  - ✅ Idea generation (IdeaForge, ChaosEngine)
  - ✅ Validation (FailureDB, AdversarialReview)
  - ✅ Grant writing (GrantWriter, ResearchPricer) ← NEW
  - ✅ Execution (ExperimentDesigner, Turingo) ← NEW
  - ✅ Literature (LitReviewBot, PaperMiner) ← NEW
  - ✅ Consultation (GhostResearcher) ← NEW
  - ✅ Publication (AbstractWriter, AutoPaper)

**TalAI becomes the COMPLETE research automation suite.**

No more "I wish there was a tool for X" - TalAI HAS the tool.
