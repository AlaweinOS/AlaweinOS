**Day 3 Target:** 2 more products, ~$330 credit used

**Total:** 8 new products + 3 existing = 11 total platforms
**Credit Used:** ~$870 of $1000

## Quick-Build Strategy

For each product:
1. Core functionality only (no UI polish)
2. CLI interface first
3. Test with 1-2 real examples
4. Document in README
5. Move to next

**No time for:**
- Perfect UIs
- Extensive testing
- Full documentation
- Marketing sites

**Focus on:**
- Working code
- Core value proposition
- Demonstrable results
- Quick wins

## Implementation Approach

Each product follows this pattern:
```
1. Create directory
2. Write main Python script (200-400 lines)
3. Add requirements.txt
4. Write README with examples
5. Test once
6. Move on
```

**Time budget per component:**
- Planning: 30 min
- Core code: 3-5 hours
- Testing: 30 min
- Documentation: 1 hour
- Total: 5-7 hours

## Success Metrics

**Minimum viable success:**
- 6+ distinct, functional products
- Each solves a real problem
- Each has working demo
- All documented

**Stretch goal:**
- 10+ products
- Some integration between products
- All tested with real examples

## What to Skip

- Complex UIs (CLI only)
- User authentication
- Databases (use files)
- Cloud deployment (local only)
- Payment systems
- Marketing materials
- Perfect error handling
- Comprehensive tests

## What's Essential

- Working core functionality
- Clear README
- 1 working example
- Basic error messages
- Simple CLI

## Starting Now

Priority 1: **AdversarialReview**
- Fastest to build
- Immediate value
- Uses existing AI capabilities
- 4 hours max
