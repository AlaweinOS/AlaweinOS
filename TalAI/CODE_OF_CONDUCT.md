# Code of Conduct

We are committed to a welcoming, inclusive community. All participants are expected to:

- Be respectful and considerate
- Practice constructive feedback
- Collaborate and share knowledge
- Uphold community standards

Unacceptable behavior includes harassment, discrimination, personal attacks, or sustained disruption.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:
- Email `security@alawein.com` or `meshal@berkeley.edu`
- Include context, links, and timestamps when possible

We will review and take appropriate action.

## Enforcement

Maintainership may take corrective actions, including warnings, issue/PR moderation, and removal from participation where necessary.

This policy complements repository-specific guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
